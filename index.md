### My Favorite Labs in CPSC 120L

*   Lab 2, part 1, was one of my favorite labs because it was the first time we had to write more than one line of code. The first lab introduced me to what would be expected in future labs and emphasized the importance of teamwork in solving problems through coding. This lab made coding enjoyable for me because we were tasked to create a mad lib, allowing users to input silly responses to generate funny outputs. I primarily learned how to use the cout and cin statements to print responses, take user input, and store the responses. Additionally, I gained experience in changing directories and improved my skills in using Linux. Learning essential commands like make all, format, and lint will be fundamental for future labs. Ultimately, I built a solid foundation for my future coding projects.

*   Lab 5, part 1, was one of my favorite labs because I was tasked with creating a calculator to find the area of a rectangle based on user inputs. I enjoyed this lab, as it combined one of my favorite subjects, math and implimented this with real-world applications. The program quickly provides the area of a rectangular space when given the appropriate values. During this lab, I learned a lot, including using if statements. We used if statements to check whether the length and width were more significant than 0. If they were, the program would proceed to calculate the area. I also learned how to call functions in the main file, allowing the user to input their data and have the code run through the necessary functions. Additionally, I gained more practice with cin and cout statements.

* Lab 7, Part 1, was my favorite among all the labs because the problem presented to the class was unique. We were given four streets, each with its own parking rules. My partner and I had to understand and determine the exact timings for when parking was acceptable and when it wasn't. This task felt like solving a puzzle, which was enjoyable; it reminded me of when my parents and I would sit together and work on puzzles during my childhood. Participating in this lab brought back those fond memories. During this experience, I learned how to use logical operators to create if, else, if, and else statements to evaluate whether the user input was valid based on the specified conditions.
