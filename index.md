### My Favorite Labs in CPSC 120L

*   Lab 2, part 1, was one of my favorite labs because it was one of our first labs where we had to write more than one line of code. The first lab introduced me to what future labs would be expected of and how we should work as a team and come together to solve various problems through writing code. This lab-made coding was fun for me because we had to create a mad lib that allowed the user to input silly responses to produce an output. I mainly learned how to use cout and cin statements to print the responses, take the responses entered by the user, and store them. I also learned to change directories in this lab and use Linux better. Learning the make all, make format, and make lint are fundamentals in every lab. I was able to build the basics for future coding projects.

*   Lab 5, part 1, was another one of my favorite labs because I was tasked to create a calculator that would find the area of a rectangle based on the inputs given by the user. I enjoyed this lab a lot because it included one of my favorite subjects, math, and how it had real-world applications in which it would find an area of a rectangular space given a value quickly. In the lab, I learned many things, including if statements. In the lab, we used if statements to check whether the length and width were more significant than 0, and if they were, then the program would continue and find the area. I also learned how to call functions in the main file, allowing the user to input their data, and the code would run it through the necessary functions. I also got more practice with cin and cout statements.
